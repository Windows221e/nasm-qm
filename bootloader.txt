;mini bootloader

global_start
;segment registers also have an equation
/*
physical address = (A * 0x10) + B
this is to address the memory
*/
/* bios executed from rom(read only mem)
bios executed the os with 0x7c00
executed bootloader which loads kernel
bootloader is responsible for loading loading operating system
bootloader only uses 16 bits
it loads kernel to mem into 32 bit protective mode which loads up the operating sys
bios will search all storage mediums for a boot signature which is 0x55AA
mediums(usb stick, floppy drive ect)
bios always uses 16 bit code which is limited until they load the kernel from the rom
the bios is also a kernel since it uses 16 bit code and it runs from rom
